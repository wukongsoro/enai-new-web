    content: `# How AI-Powered Sales Collaboration Transforms B2B Revenue Generation

The B2B sales landscape is undergoing unprecedented transformation, driven by rapid AI adoption and shifting buyer expectations. According to recent industry reports, [79% of sales professionals now use AI tools](https://www.lawnext.com/2024/10/ai-adoption-by-legal-professionals-jumps-from-19-to-79-in-one-year-clio-study-finds.html?), a dramatic increase from just 19% in 2023. This surge reflects broader market pressures: tighter budgets, more sophisticated buyers, and the need to do more with less.
